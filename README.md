# Description
SenPie is an imaginary anime-themed bakery that now has a website designed to allow users to login/create an account and order some baked goods for pickup. This site uses Express, multiple Postgres databases, and EJS to allow users to create accounts, order goods, and checkout the food in their cart.
# Project Status
Updates are being worked on regularly by the team and will be added to the site as they are created.
